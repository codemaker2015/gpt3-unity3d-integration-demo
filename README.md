# AICommand

This is a proof-of-concept integration of ChatGPT into Unity Editor. You can
control the Editor using natural language prompts.

## How to try it

You have to generate an API key to use the ChatGPT API. Please generate it on
your [account page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and set it on
the Project Settings page (Edit > Project Settings > AI Command > API Key).

**CAUTION** - The API key is stored in `UserSettings/AICommandSettings.asset`.
You must exclude the directory when sharing your project with others.

You can open the AI Command window from Window > AI Command.

## System requirements

Unity 2022.2 or later

## Frequently asked questions

### Is it practical?

**Definitely no!** I created this proof-of-concept and proved that it doesn't
work yet. It works nicely in some cases and fails very poorly in others. I got
several ideas from those successes and failures, which is this project's main
aim.

### Can I install this to my project?

This is just a proof-of-concept project, so there is no standard way to install
it in other projects. If you want to try it with your project anyway, you can
simply copy the `Assets/Editor` directory to your project.
